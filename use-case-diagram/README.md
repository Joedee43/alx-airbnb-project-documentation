# Airbnb Clone System Use Case Diagram Explanation

## Overview
This document explains the use case diagram for the Airbnb clone system, illustrating the interactions between users and the system's core functionalities.

## Actors in the System
The diagram identifies four primary actors:

- **Guest:** Users who search for and book properties.
- **Host:** Users who list and manage properties.
- **Admin:** System administrators who manage the platform.
- **Payment System:** External payment processing service.

## Key Use Cases by Category

### Authentication & User Management (Blue)
- **Register Account:** New users can create an account.
- **Login:** Users can authenticate themselves.
- **Manage Profile:** Users can update their personal information.
- **Verify Identity:** Users can verify their identity for trust and safety.

### Property Management (Yellow)
- **Create Property:** Hosts can list new properties.
- **Manage Listings:** Hosts can edit or update property details.
- **Set Availability:** Hosts can manage when their property is available.
- **Upload Images:** Hosts can add photos of their property.

### Search & Booking (Green)
- **Search Properties:** Guests can find properties based on criteria.
- **View Property:** Users can see detailed property information.
- **Book Property:** Guests can make reservations.
- **Manage Bookings:** Both guests and hosts can view and manage reservations.

### Payment & Reviews (Red/Orange)
- **Process Payment:** System handles payment collection.
- **Manage Payouts:** System manages payments to hosts.
- **Issue Refunds:** System processes refunds when needed.
- **Write Reviews:** Users can leave feedback after stays.

### Communication (Teal)
- **Message Host/Guest:** Users can communicate with each other.

### Admin Functions (Purple)
- **Manage Users:** Admins can oversee user accounts.
- **Moderate Listings:** Admins can review and control property listings.
- **Generate Reports:** Admins can analyze platform metrics.
- **Handle Disputes:** Admins can resolve conflicts between users.
- **Configure Settings:** Admins can adjust system parameters.
- **Manage Support:** Admins can provide customer support.

## Important Relationships
The diagram shows critical relationships between use cases:

- **Include Relationships:** Indicates that one use case necessarily includes the behavior of another.
  - *Book Property* includes *View Property* (you must view a property to book it).
  - *View Property* includes *Search Properties* (viewing typically follows searching).

- **Extend Relationships:** Indicates optional behavior.
  - *Process Payment* extends *Book Property* (payment processing is part of the booking flow).

## System Boundary
The system boundary (represented by a large rectangle) delineates what's inside the Airbnb clone system versus external actors, helping identify the scope of the system implementation.

## Design Considerations
This use case diagram is designed to:
- Comprehensively cover all core functionalities identified in the feature document.
- Clearly distinguish different types of users and their interactions.
- Show relationships between related use cases to indicate flow and dependencies.
- Color-code by function type for better visualization and grouping.
- Include both primary and supporting functionalities for a complete view.

## Conclusion
The diagram provides a clear visual representation of how users will interact with the system and what functionality needs to be implemented. It serves as an excellent reference for developers, stakeholders, and project managers to understand the system's scope and functionality.
